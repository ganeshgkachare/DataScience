    "MongoDB is a NoSQL document-oriented database management system that stores data in a JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). It is designed to be scalable, flexible, and high-performance, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. MongoDB is an open-source database and provides many features such as indexing, ad-hoc queries, sharding, replication, and load balancing.\n",

    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are designed to handle unstructured data and large-scale applications that require high levels of scalability and availability. Non-relational databases use various data models to store and manage data, such as key-value, document-based, column-family, and graph databases.\n",

    "### Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "The features of MongoDB are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-oriented: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means that it stores data in a JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). This allows for flexible data structures and makes it easy to work with unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema-less: MongoDB is a schema-less database, which means that there is no need to define a rigid data schema upfront. This allows for more flexibility and makes it easier to handle changing data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "High performance: MongoDB is designed to be high-performance and can handle large amounts of data and high levels of traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB is designed to be highly scalable and can be used in distributed environments, where data is spread across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: MongoDB provides support for various types of indexing, such as single-field, compound, and geospatial indexes, which allows for fast and efficient queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation framework: MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that allows for complex data processing, such as grouping, filtering, and transforming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic sharding: MongoDB provides automatic sharding, which allows for the distribution of data across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication: MongoDB provides replication, which allows for the creation of multiple copies of data to ensure high availability and fault tolerance."

    "\n",
    "These methods are useful when there is a need to delete data from the database or clear the entire collection. For example, if an application has user accounts that need to be removed due to inactivity or other reasons, the delete_many() method can be used to delete all inactive user accounts. Similarly, if a collection is no longer needed, the drop() method can be used to delete the entire collection from the database."
